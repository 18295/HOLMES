	Spaceflight began in the 20th century following theoretical and practical 
	breakthroughs by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and Robert H. Goddard. The Soviet 
	Union took the lead in the post-war Space Race, 
	launching the first satellite, the first man and the first woman into orbit. 
	The United States caught up with, and then passed, their Soviet rivals during the mid-1960s, 
	landing the first man on the Moon in 1969. In the same period, France, the United Kingdom, 
	Japan and China were concurrently developing more limited launch capabilities.

        Following the end of the Space Race, spaceflight has been characterised by greater international 
	co-operation, cheaper access to low Earth orbit and an expansion of commercial ventures. 
	Interplanetary probes have visited all of the planets in the Solar System, and humans have remained 
	in orbit for long periods aboard space stations such as Mir and the ISS. Most recently, China has 
	emerged as the third nation with the capability to launch independent manned missions, whilst operators 
	in the commercial sector have developed re-usable booster systems and craft launched from airborne platforms.
